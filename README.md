# Hugging Face Question Answering Model

This project demonstrates a question-answering system using Hugging Face's transformer models. The system is capable of answering questions based on a given context by leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on the SQuAD dataset.

## Introduction

The Hugging Face Question Answering Model is built to provide accurate answers to questions based on a given context. By utilizing state-of-the-art transformer models from Hugging Face, the system can be trained and fine-tuned on large-scale datasets, making it versatile and powerful for various applications.

## Methodology

### Setup and Installation

To get started, you need to install the required libraries:

```sh
!pip install transformers --quiet
!pip install datasets --quiet
```

### Loading and Preparing the Dataset
The model uses the SQuAD dataset, which can be loaded and prepared for training as follows:

1. Load the dataset using the datasets library.
2. Convert the dataset to a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
3. Print the first row to understand the structure of the data.

### Tokenization and Dataset Preparation
Tokenization is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for training. The following steps outline the tokenization process:

1. Tokenizing the Dataset:

  - Tokenize the dataset based on context and questions.
  - Ensure the dataset is truncated and padded appropriately.

2. Creating Target Variables:

  - Identify the start and end positions of answers within the context.
  - Store these positions for training the model.

### Model Selection and Training

The project uses the `distilroberta-base` model from Hugging Face. The steps for training include:

1. Downloading the Pre-trained Model:

  - Use TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering to download the pre-trained model.
  - Ensure the model head is fine-tuned for the specific task.
    
2. Compiling and Training the Model:

  - Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and a custom learning rate.
  - Train the model using the prepared tokenized dataset.
  - Save the trained model for future use.

### Answer Generation

A function is created to generate answers based on the context and question provided. The process includes:

1. Tokenizing the Input:
  - Tokenize the input question and context.

2. Generating Output:
  - Use the model to generate start and end logits.
  - Decode the tokens to get the final answer.

### Running the Model
To run the model, follow these steps:

1. Install Required Libraries:

Ensure all necessary libraries are installed:
```python
pip install transformers datasets
```
2. Load and Prepare the Dataset and Train:
  - Load the SQuAD dataset and prepare it for training.
  - Tokenize the dataset and create target variables.
  - Compile and train the model using the tokenized dataset.
  - Save the trained model.
3. enerate Answers:

Use the `answer_generator` function to generate answers based on the context and question provided.

## Results
The model demonstrates robust performance on the SQuAD dataset, achieving notable accuracy in generating answers. Below are some sample results:

`context = '''Hugging Face was founded in 2016 by Clément Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf originally as a company that developed a chatbot app targeted at teenagers. After open-sourcing the model behind the chatbot, the company pivoted to focus on being a platform for democratizing machine learning. In March 2021, Hugging Face raised $40 million in a Series B funding round.'''`

`question = 'Who are the Hugging Face founders?'`

`answer = Clément Delangue, Julien Chaumond, and Thomas Wolf`

The model accurately identifies the founders of Hugging Face from the provided context.

## Conclusion

The Hugging Face Question Answering Model is a powerful tool for extracting answers from a given context. By leveraging pre-trained transformer models and fine-tuning them on the SQuAD dataset, the system can provide accurate and reliable answers, making it suitable for various applications in natural language understanding and information retrieval.
